This is the Greyhound 2.0 Development Channel

This is going to be a full port of Greyhound/Wraith code to .NET, not every feature will be ported, just those I use on a daily basis and I think with be useful to the majority of users, if you want features, pay me.

Why bother porting to .NET? Well I want to learn more about C# and .NET, and try porting a relatively complex program to another language, and also because I can, it's fun, gives me something to do, and allows me to easily add new features both myself and others use in the future. If you have a problem with it then ok.

If you'd like to keep track of stuff, check the todo lists if I've posted them yet.
