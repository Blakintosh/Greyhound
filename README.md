**Due to a recent game ban in Modern Warfare, this project is no longer maintained, please do not ask for support or if xyz feature is coming, it's completely abandoned, if an update breaks it, I won't be here to fix it. I've put so much time and effort into maintaining this project, and a lot of effort into my own MW account leveling it up and playing with friends, that I don't see the point in continuing if game bans are going to be thrown my way.**

**Is Greyhound still safe to use? Probably, however I recommend not using it in public games, since Activision and Infinity Ward don't bother to even provide paying customers with a reason as to why they block them from accessing the games, it's hard to know if my ban was because of Greyhound, but from what I can tell, it's still safe to use and my ban must be for something else, but keep to out of public matches to be on the safe side unless you want to take the risk.**

**I want to thank everyone who has supported me and what I've done for legitimate CoD Modding, maintaining this project has taught me a lot and it's probably for the best that I drop it, as I want to pursue different things including providing direct content for CoD Modders to use such as AI, tutorials, etc.**

**Also while I highly appreciate it, I'm rejecting offers for people to repurchase the game for me, I've put more effort into MW than any recent CoD, and I want my account back, not a new one, I can easily rebuy the game, and Activision and Infinity Ward have made it clear it's a permanent ban with no appeal system in place, so there is no point in accepting a new copy of the game as everything else can be done via WZ.**
