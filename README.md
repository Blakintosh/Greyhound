**THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED. Unfortunately today I was banned on Modern Warfare, a game I actively play and enjoy and have not once cheated in or caused issues for other players in, I played it normally. I got into reverse engineering primarly to get access to more information Treyarch never gave in Bo3, and further enhanced my skills by maintaining Wraith, I never intended to get on the bad side of any companies or cause issues for them, I done this primarly for fun as I do with legit game modding using their official SDKs. Since it's clear this ban is more than likely a direct attack against me on Infinity Ward/Activisions part as I can't think of anything I've done to trigger the full anti-cheat to ban me in the past 6 months, I would like to do whatever I can to not piss them off any more than I probably already have, it's clear they don't like whatever I'm doing, and I would rather not get any more of my accounts banned or cause any more issues, I do this for free and for fun, so I am going to step down from working on any of the my extractors for Call of Duty, it is not worth the hassle.**

**I want to thank everynone I've ran into and who have helped me, or have become my friend, but I must move on now.**

# Greyhound - A fork of Wraith Archon, Call of Duty Asset Extractor
[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Scobalula/Greyhound/total.svg)](https://github.com/Scobalula/Greyhound/releases) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Scobalula/Greyhound.svg)](https://github.com/Scobalula/Greyhound/blob/master/LICENSE) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-Discord-blue.svg)](https://discord.gg/RyqyThu)

Greyhound is a fork of the famous [Wraith Archon](https://github.com/dtzxporter/WraithXArchon/) by DTZxPorter. It is an extraction tool for Call of Duty, supporting XModels, XAnims, Images, and more depending on the game. With Greyhound I hope to ensure updates to the tool for both current and future titles, and bring more features to aid in working with the games.
